        <p>Full-service restaurants, ice cream shops, soda fountains, diners, and people at home usually prepare and mix the shake by hand from scoops of ice cream and milk in a blender or drink mixer. Hand-blended milkshakes are traditionally made from any flavor of ice cream; additional flavorings, such as chocolate syrup, malt syrup, or malted milk powder, can be added prior to mixing. This allows a greater variety than is available in machine-made shakes.</p>
        <p>Many fast food outlets do not make shakes by hand with ice cream; instead, they make shakes in automatic milkshake machines which freeze and serve a pre-made milkshake mixture consisting of milk, a sweetened flavoring agent, and a thickening agent. These are similar to soft-serve ice cream machines, but keep the shake at a drinkable consistency.</p>
